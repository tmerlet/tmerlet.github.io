Tahoma: A Microsoft Font

This font is included with all major operating systems, including almost all versions of Microsoft Windows
and Apple's Mac OS X. If you're using one of these operating systems, you already have this font installed
and no further action is necessary on your part to make use of it.

If you're using a Unix-like or Unix-variant operating system like Linux or BSD, a metric-compatible replacement
font is included with Wine:
